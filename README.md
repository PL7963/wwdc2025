### Mimories is an app that allows you to keep your memories with short phrases and image. 
It was inspired by the moment when I was scrolling through my own Facebook profile. Even there are few people read it. I have never been the type of person who likes to keep diaries. And even think it's boring to read those plain texts. I still found it's interesting the see what photos I've taken even it's a meaningless image to other people and only described by few phrases. So I created this app, allows people who may not want to share certain private info on the platform and are still able to keep memories in the way like on social media. Also encourage people to take more photos of their lives.
